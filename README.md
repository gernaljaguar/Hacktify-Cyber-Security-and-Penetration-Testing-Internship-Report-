This one-month internship involved tackling real-world cybersecurity challenges, identifying and exploiting web
application vulnerabilities. The first three weeks focused on key areas such as HTML Injection, IDOR, XSS, SQL
Injection, CORS, and CSRF. In the final week, CTF challenges were solved across domains like Web application,
Network Forensics, Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, and OSINT. The internship enhanced problem-solving
and security analytical skills, provided hands-on experience in ethical hacking, and strengthened expertise in
attack mitigation, defense strategies, documentation, and professional report writing.
